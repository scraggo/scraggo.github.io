Dave demonstrates all of these principles with seven standard jazz tunes, some based on modality and the others based on standard tonality. Modal tunes used are \"So What,\" \"All Blues,\" and \"Footprints.\" Standards used are \"Autumn Leaves,\" \"All The Things You Are,\" \"Blue Bossa\", and \"Honeysuckle Rose.\" 26 pages of material are prepared in TAB and standard notation.

Not only will you be able to see exactly how a great number of chords, voicings, and extensions come from the scale in a visual way, but an exhaustive number of fingering options will be discussed including position playing, 3 notes per string, sliding scales, full range scales and more.

My method of \"highlighting/aiming\" for scale degrees is discussed in depth so that each new position will sound convincing from the first time you try it. Common turnarounds will be discussed as well.

Included is an in-depth discussion on playing each of the five barre chord shapes and the general method behind finding where they are on the fretboard. Also how to play the scale and visualize it within the chord shape. We are also going to explore the five possibilities of changing between the three chords of the twelve bar blues in the same position.

This incredibly popular YouTube lesson also has an accompanying lesson PDF.\n\n**[Beginner Jazz Guitar Basic Shell Chord Voicings using Autumn Leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jaMYQIPa_Q)** In this lesson, using the jazz standard Autumn Leaves, I explore basic shell voicings which are simple on the hands, make jazz tensions possible, and promote mobility across the guitar neck. These are either Root, 3rd, 7th voicings (if the 5th string is the root) or Root, 7th, 3rd voicings (if the 6th string is the root).\n\n### Category: Guitar Warmups\n\n**[Guitar Warmup - String Skipping and Stretching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46EwN4nsuSY)** This guitar warmup includes the working of all combinations of the 4 left hand fingers, stretches, and inside/outside picking with string skips. It's a doozy - hope you enjoy. It is recommended for intermediate to advanced players.\n`;\n\nexport default () => {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <SEO title=\"Music Teaching Resources\" />\n      <div className=\"text-wrapper\">\n        <ReactMarkdown children={markdown} />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
