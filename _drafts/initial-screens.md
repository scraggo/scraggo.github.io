- title: "Making a good first impression on your initial programming job screen"

The phone screen is where you make a first impression on a company to which you're applying. Your resume surely made a positive impact, but the most important evaluation is yet to come: making a _human_ connection with a company recruiter. They'll be (subconsciously) taking notes on how you speak, your confidence level, how passionate you are, and much more.

Having done around 28 phone screens, I want to share what I've learned from those experiences.

## What to prepare

**A more in-depth statement about why you've applied to their company.**

You (hopefully) said it in your cover letter, but rehearse these points out loud:

- What about the company and position appeals to you

- Why you're a good fit

example: ...

- Examples from your past projects that fit the role

example: ...

Get a big picture overview of the role, what they might ask

If it's a **\_ role, prepare **

If you aren't the best with \_\_\_, here are some ways of replying to a question you're not sure about (or don't have any answer)...

- A general spiel about your salary needs (and what you're bottom line is)

> My past salaries don't really count because the pay was based on me still learning the craft. I know the industry average pay for Junior developers is $X. That's my bottom line. Ideally I'd be making between $Y and \$Z and I'd be happy to talk about bonus structures in order to make that.

Early indicators of fit for me

How it can be nerve-racking

Mistakes (were they?)

## Technical competence

Most open roles require a developer to have competence in specific languages or tech stacks. If the role is a heavy Java or Python role and you don't have significant experience in either area, it might be a deal-breaker right away. A quick evaluation for yourself:

- Have you built a project (not based on a tutorial) with the specific language or stack?
- Do you have significant experience in a _very_ similar environment and are confident you could pick up the new tech? (Example: the job wants a Vue.js developer, but you've only worked in React.)

Be prepared to explain how your experience fits what they need technically. It's **always** good to shown enthusiasm for learning their specific tech if you don't already know it.

## Company Values

If you meet the baseline level of technical fit, the below values are a mix of soft and technical values for a company:

CULTURE FIT

High value is placed on the candidate's background, personality, style, and/or traits that make them part of a unified team.

EXPERIENCE

High value is placed on a candidate having started and finished many large projects. They could do this alone or lead a team. A high level of confidence is required and the company is usually seeking a senior-level engineer.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

High value is placed on the candidate being able to "see the big picture." They aren't stuck in a single mindset, language, or framework. They are very enthusiastic about learning and can do so quickly.

SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE

High value is placed on the candidate being experts in specific tools, methodologies, languages, or frameworks.

PAY

High value is placed on a candidate being willing to accept a definite maximum salary.

CLIENT INTERACTION

High value is placed on a candidate being cool with working with clients, traveling, or other non-coding duties.
