When developing on a team, it can sometimes be difficult to sort out the meaning of other team members' commit messages. Oftentimes, for myself, I'm tempted to write a commit message quickly so I can push my branch at the end of a workday.

One team member brought the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) format to our attention. I've enjoyed using it and seeing the results when reviewing pull requests.

To enforce this pattern, I recommend using this tool: [conventional-changelog/commitlint: ðŸ““ Lint commit messages](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

Verbatim from the readme:

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

```txt
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional
```

Real world examples can look like this:

```txt
chore: run tests on travis ci
fix(server): send cors headers
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test
