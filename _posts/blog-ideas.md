## CodePen Chicago - My First Programming Meetup
I was definitely nervous before going to my first programming meetup. I was concerned that I needed to have something polished to show off or everyone would think I was a fraud. I wound up having a lot of fun! I learned a lot about what technologies are out there. I was inspired by how passionate everyone who presented was about coding.

I've used CodePen for some basic projects and was surprised to learn what it's capable of. One developer made a fun little game using Vue. It seemed incredibly easy to integrate it (in the Settings section of the pen). 

The pens using Firebase impressed me to no end. It seemed very straightforward to get something with a somewhat complex back end up and running.

I consider myself a developer moreso than a designer. The complexity of the graphics [GreenSock on CodePen](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/) were amazing. The programmatic interfaces he designed blew my mind.

## Practical Regex - Some Real Life Scenarios

I love regular expressions. They're a mini-programming language that can be a bit confusing when you first encounter it. If I notice some find-replace of text has a general pattern, I always take the time to find the right regex pattern.

Here are some you can practice with:

- Copying text from Slack
- URLS: chrome extension, 
- Organizing text, finding new-line characters
