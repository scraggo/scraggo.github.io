# Possible titles
- What coding jobs are out there for inexperienced coders?
- Programming jobs for self-taught coders

## Intro
Finding jobs can be a difficult endeavor. For someone who's learning programming on their own, it can be disheartening when you see a lot of job ads requiring either 2+ years of professional experience or a Computer Science degree. I'm a self-taught coder with experience in web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc) and Python. Compiling some info from job listings has been quite enlightening. What I'm looking for is the intersection between what I love to do and what's in demand in my area (Chicago, IL, USA).

## Python-related Jobs
1\. Bots (read more on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-write-a-bot-using-Python))

If you can automate tasks on the web using Mechanize, Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, there are many freelance temp jobs as well as part-time and full-time jobs.

2\. GUIs

There are [many different GUI frameworks](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) you could learn in Python. Making an effective GUI for a program is always in demand.

3\. Flask, Django, and more

Flask and Django are the famous Python backend frameworks. Django is used in [some well-known websites](http://www.bedjango.com/blog/top-5-sites-built-django-framework/). I hadn't heard of [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) frameworks before looking at job listings, so it may behoove you to have a niche.

## JavaScript / Web

1\. JavaScript Frameworks

React, Angular 2, and Ember seem to be the most requested frameworks in my area. Angular 2 and Ember are full MVC frameworks, while React users will need to add components to get MVC functionality.

2\. Mobile Frameworks

Ionic is an HTML5 framework which allows you to make mobile apps without using native iOS or Android languages. Ionic needs a native wrapper like Cordova or PhoneGap in order to run as a native app.

3\. CSS Preprocessors and Frameworks

Sass (.scss) is in demand for its capabilities to write css with variables and other helpful mechanisms. Twitter Bootstrap is excellent for easily designing pages.

4\. Back-end Frameworks

I've seen a lot of listings that use the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON. Express.js is a framework that adds useful web-capabilities to Node. Node is a stand-alone JavaScript engine designed to build scalable network applications. It runs events asynchronously, which enables it to easily handle complex network requests.

## Services

1\. [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/)

Many companies are using AWS, so it's worth investigating.

2\. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/)

Google's Firebase is a full-fledged mobile platform and server.


## The Rest: PHP, Ruby, Apple, Microsoft, Go, and more

I'll leave the rest of my research here for anyone interested to investigate. Best of luck in your learning and job-searching!
