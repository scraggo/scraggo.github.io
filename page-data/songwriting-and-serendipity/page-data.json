When I was first learning guitar and had much less skill, I tried to figure out songs that I heard. I was usually unsuccessful at transcribing them accurately, but there were many occasions that I enjoyed what I was playing (despite it being wrong) and wrote a song based on it. I call that <strong>Serendipity</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What is “serendipity?”</h2>\n<p>This is where a composer stumbles on a cool sounding idea without even intending to do so. I believe that the act of “trying” often defeats the purpose, especially for a songwriter. So, in this video lesson, I’m going to play some well-known riffs wrong - intentionally. Then I’m going to mess with them - repeat just one part of the riff, invert the intervals, change the rhythm, and other compositional devices that I encourage you to try yourself.</p>\n<h2>My starting points</h2>\n<p>I chose songs from the following 5 decades as my starting points: the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, and 2000’s. Can you identify what songs I’m using?</p>\n<p><em>A word of <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">CAUTION</span>: Make sure your idea is different enough from your inspiration to avoid getting sued over copyright issues!</em></p>\n<h2>Compositional devices</h2>\n<p>As an exercise to the student, can you pick out how I’m changing the music that I’m using as a starting point? In future lessons, I will talk in more detail about variation techniques and how to use them in your songs.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/songwriting-and-serendipity/"},"frontmatter":{"author":"Dave Cohen","categories":["music"],"date":"November 15, 2015","description":null,"tags":["songwriting"],"title":"Songwriting and Serendipity"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/songwriting-and-serendipity/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/songwriting-simplicity-complexity/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["songwriting"],"title":"Songwriting Tutorial: Simplicity and Complexity","type":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/songwriting-snippet-challenge/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["songwriting"],"title":"Songwriting Tutorial: Snippet Challenge","type":"post"}}}}}
