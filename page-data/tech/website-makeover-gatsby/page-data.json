One of my new year‚Äôs resolutions is to redo my website with a lot of new things in mind. Here I‚Äôll outline the changes I‚Äôm in the process of making. <em>EDIT Jan 18, 2020: Gatsby makeover complete!</em></p>\n<h2>Now live: custom domain name <code class=\"language-text\">scraggo.com</code></h2>\n<p>An important step in the whole makeover was getting an official domain name - I‚Äôm now live at <a href=\"https://www.scraggo.com\"><code class=\"language-text\">scraggo.com</code></a>! I‚Äôm using <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/\">namecheap</a> as the provider. The site has been hosted with <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">github pages</a> since its inception and I‚Äôll probably continue to host it here.</p>\n<h2>New year, new static site generator</h2>\n<p>My most pressing need is to be able to put content in multiple categories on one site. My content is fragmented between a WordPress site, miscellaneous blogs, and local files. I am slowly, but surely consolidating everything I want to share online here (with only a few intentional exceptions.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/\">Blog posts</a> about <a href=\"/music\">music</a>, <a href=\"/tech\">technology</a>, and <a href=\"/other\">‚Äúother‚Äù</a> (with the ability to filter for each type of post)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/tech/projects\">My tech portfolio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/music/discography\">My music discography</a></li>\n<li>Any other publications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This blog (Tech Effects) has been built with the <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll static site generator</a> since 2018. Jekyll has been good to me so far and it‚Äôs an incredibly powerful tool. Despite this, I‚Äôm much more familiar with the JavaScript ecosystem and uninterested in spending time learning Ruby dependency management (Jekyll is coded in Ruby) for the plugin upgrades I need. There‚Äôs been a lot of hype about Gatsby over the past couple of years - and I have zero regrets about giving it a shot.</p>\n<h3>Get started with Gatsby</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/\">Gatsby Tutorials - Official</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/guides/\">Gatsby Guides - Official</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What I‚Äôm loving about Gatsby</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Layout and Templating - Gatsby uses React for templating. I felt limited by the capabilities of the liquid layouts system provided by Jekyll.</li>\n<li>GraphQL - I finally have an excuse to use it!</li>\n<li>Flexibility - The Gatsby‚Äôs plugins that are available seem to have anticipated all my needs. I don‚Äôt feel confused by what‚Äôs possible like I did with the Jekyll configuration.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem - I have all the React packages available from <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code> that I want to use.</li>\n<li>Pages and slugs - I‚Äôm able to organize the site however I want - tech/music/other categories (with corresponding urls) and post slugs can be in whatever format I choose.</li>\n<li>Syntax highlighting and line highlighting - I‚Äôll be stepping up my game with the rendering of code blocks in my posts.</li>\n<li>Hot reloading</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What has been tricky</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Files and urls - The site architecture took some getting used to. It seems to make sense to have the <code class=\"language-text\">pages</code> folder only for site pages, not content. That goes into a <code class=\"language-text\">./content</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Images - handling dynamic images with GraphQL. I found myself opting out in a lot of scenarios. This creates another problem - I have to recreate the <code class=\"language-text\">public</code> folder if the cache in dev mode gets stale.</li>\n<li>Deploying - I had to implement a workaround to deploy to Github Pages. The <code class=\"language-text\">CNAME</code> file gets obliterated on-deploy. The workaround is a <code class=\"language-text\">bash</code> script that copies the file over pre-deploy (along with the image files mentioned above).</li>\n<li>GraphQL queries - I used a messy Regular Expression in a GraphQL query to exclude a folder in that directory (which, to be fair, I won‚Äôt need to actually do). I‚Äôm still getting used to GraphQL queries in general. They are NOT traditional template strings - you can‚Äôt just throw in JavaScript variables as you please:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> query <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> graphql<span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">\n  </span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>notAllowed<span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\">\n</span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I haven‚Äôt <em>needed</em> to do this, but I have some code duplication amongst my queries. (Apparently <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-graphql-fragments/\">Fragments</a> are canonical way to achieve this, but they‚Äôre a bit too complex for my needs right now.)</p>\n<h2>What‚Äôs remaining</h2>\n<p>There‚Äôs small, but mighty list of remaining things to do including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing old content to work with the new format</li>\n<li>Improving the styling</li>\n<li>Creating tag archives</li>\n<li>and more‚Ä¶</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Signing off</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôm really looking forward to the unveiling of my new site once all the updates are to complete.</p>\n<p>I hope you‚Äôre having a great new year.
