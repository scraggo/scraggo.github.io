After choosing something, stay in that mindset until you find the need for a well-placed and meaningful contrast.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s important to capture your ideas as you create them by recording and/or writing them down.</strong></p>\n<h3>Choose a musical direction by planning ahead.</h3>\n<p>Now we can begin to create/refine germs of both musical and lyrical ideas. Then, you can play/improvise to find the mood and tempo.</p>\n<h3>Analyze what you’ve played</h3>\n<p>Ideas evolve by intelligently asking how to serve the original idea. This allows you to generate more ideas based on what you have.</p>\n<h3>Are you adding to the meaning or making it unclear?**</h3>\n<p>Always ask “Do I like it? Is it “filler?” Constantly shape your song by refining the message, not intentionally being “different” or obfuscating the point.</p>\n<h3>Interest can be created without intentionally bending the rules.</h3>\n<p>While getting used to this process, there’s no need to stray from tried-and-true methods of writing a song.</p>\n<h3>Plug into song forms and lyric templates.</h3>\n<p>When you use forms and templates, it leads to songwriting that is easily followed by a listener. I will discuss the following in great detail, but for now, refer to <a href=\"https://speedsongwriting.com/about/\">Graham English Speed Songwriting Course</a> for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rhyme Schemes</li>\n<li>Where your title fits in</li>\n<li>Point of View: 1st, 2nd, 3rd person</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Knowledge of Diatonic Music Theory</h3>\n<p>Knowing the difference between major and minor helps serve the message of the song. There are other modes besides these 2 that we’ll explore later. You can change keys globally and locally to add complexity, but only if that serves the song’s central message.</p>\n<h3>Your foundation depends on simplicity.</h3>\n<p>It’s easy to fall in love with bending the rules for it’s own sake (as evidenced by my own stylistic quirks), but you can write a great song by remaining simple in your message and form.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/songwriting-simplicity-complexity/"},"frontmatter":{"author":"Dave Cohen","categories":["music"],"date":"October 15, 2015","description":null,"tags":["songwriting"],"title":"Songwriting Tutorial: Simplicity and Complexity"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/songwriting-simplicity-complexity/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/songwriting-and-serendipity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Songwriting and Serendipity","type":"post"}}}}}
