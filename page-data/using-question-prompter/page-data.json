While many authors have written about this kind of reflection, <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2015/01/15/morning-pages/\">Tim Ferriss</a> comes to mind first. One product that helps you do this is <a href=\"https://thehustle.co/the-five-minute-journal-will-make-you-happier\">the Five-Minute Journal</a>.</p>\n<p>Knowing myself, I don’t really clamour to buy off-the-shelf solutions to these sorts of things. I’ve taken notes from a dozen great books and wanted to ask myself questions that will help me 1) remember the content and 2) get insights from custom questions inspired by the content. I’ve also come up with my own personal questions that probably don’t have the universal self-help appeal that these books have.</p>\n<h3>What’s the process for answering questions?</h3>\n<p>My goal is to answer at least one set a day. I type more quickly than I write by hand, so this can be done in a short amount of time (unless I decide to take my sweet time mulling over responses.)</p>\n<p>Once a week, I’ll comb through the files containing the answers for the week. My goal is to <em>improve iteratively</em>. I want to gain insights when I review these entries, like “what can I explore further?,” “what have I been putting off?,” etc.</p>\n<h3>What are some of the questions I’m asking?</h3>\n<p>My questions are derived from a mish-mash of my favorite books and life-experiences. (I’ve included links to book summaries to help fill in missing context.)</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Big-Leap-Conquer-Hidden-Level/dp/0061735361\">The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Summary: <a href=\"https://fourminutebooks.com/the-big-leap-summary/\">https://fourminutebooks.com/the-big-leap-summary/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>what were the upper limits you encountered today?</li>\n<li>what felt good / are you grateful for?</li>\n<li>How long did you spend in your zone of incompetence? could you have said no?</li>\n<li>How long did you spend in your zone of competence?</li>\n<li>How long did you spend in your zone of excellence?</li>\n<li>How long did you spend in your zone of genius? did you experience einstein time?</li>\n<li>Did you argue / feel like a victim today?</li>\n<li>“Newtonian time: Where in my life am I not taking full ownership?

It can be <code class=\"language-text\">json</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">yaml</code>. (I prefer <code class=\"language-text\">yaml</code> because it looks much cleaner.)</li>\n<li>We call the top-level command line interface with the path to the configuration file as a required argument. You can optionally specify the output format - it’s <code class=\"language-text\">json</code> by default.</li>\n<li>You can choose to review notes or to answer questions. If you choose to review notes, it’ll give you a list of files you can open.</li>\n<li>If you choose to answer questions, you choose which questions set you’ll answer, then answer the questions.</li>\n<li>Finally, your answers are saved with a copy of the questions in your specified output path.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Packages spotlight</h3>\n<p>There are a number of npm packages in use for the app. The highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander\">commander</a> - this is a go-to package to make the initial command line input processing easier.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer\">inquirer</a> - this is the star of the show and inspired the app. It allows you to use your keyboard to pick answers from a list of choices, fill in text answers, and a lot more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-node\">@babel/node</a> - this allows me to use ES6+ syntax in dev mode. I enjoy it!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"txt\"><pre class=\"language-txt\"><code class=\"language-txt\">|____src\n| |____io-handlers.js\n| |____index.js\n| |____inquirer.js\n| |____commander.js\n\n| |____data\n| | |____selectors.js\n\n| |____example\n| | |____experience2.txt\n| | |____experience1.txt\n| | |____example.json\n\n| |____utils\n| | |____exec.js\n| | |____fs.js</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>src/</strong></p>\n<p>These files contain the business logic of the application.</p>\n<p><strong>src/data/selectors.js</strong></p>\n<p>To select values from the user input configuration paths, I used <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pearlmcphee/selectors-react-redux-reselect-9ab984688dd4\">selectors</a>. My motivation was to keep the data model separate from the business logic so that I’d be free to change it and not affect the functions accessing them. I can also process that config lazily, on-demand, instead of doing it ahead of time.</p>\n<p>I didn’t opt-into using <code class=\"language-text\">reselect</code> because this app is very small. There’s no need to optimize performance with memoization at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>src/example</strong></p>\n<p>Here are example files so you can get started right away! Run <code class=\"language-text\">npm run start-dev-ex</code> to load them in.</p>\n<p><strong>src/utils</strong></p>\n<p>I find that wrapping utilities makes my life easier. When I call the wrappers inside business logic files (like <code class=\"language-text\">io-handlers</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">inquirer</code>), it clearly separates the file-system handling from the app-specific processing.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/contact\">Let me know</a> if you found the app useful!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/using-question-prompter/"},"frontmatter":{"author":"Dave Cohen","categories":["tech"],"date":"August 02, 2020","description":null,"tags":["JavaScript","node","productivity"],"title":"Using question-prompter for study, self-reflection, and more"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/using-question-prompter/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/meta-ideas-generating-creative-content/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Meta Ideas - Generating Creative Content","type":"post"}},"next":null}}}
