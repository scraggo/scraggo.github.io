Some other features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has a built-in text editor where you can add or edit a code snippet. It can be typed in or uploaded as a file. Afterward, you’re able to call it up with your voice.</li>\n<li>You can choose from snippets that are available publicly and add them to your personal collection.</li>\n<li>You can add your username to some common developer URLs. You could say “Github” for example, and it would pull up your GitHub page in your default web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vocode is a full-stack Javascript application. We used React, Redux, Postgres, Express, and chose to use Electron, a framework that allows you to create desktop apps with Javascript. Having it be a desktop app allowed us to set a keyboard shortcut for recording while in any text editor.</p>\n<h2>What I’d change about Vocode</h2>\n<p>Looking back at this project after a long time was a bit of a shock! Combing through it, these areas stood out to me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation was insufficient</li>\n<li>Interfaces for internal code was lacking</li>\n<li>Tests did not make definitive enough assertions</li>\n<li>Browse-ability was lacking, a mixture of domains, callback hell</li>\n<li>Performance wasn’t scrutinized</li>\n<li>Security was not on our minds</li>\n<li>Error-handling did not go beyond <code class=\"language-text\">console.error</code></li>\n<li>There was no “product” perspective that would intelligently guide the project according to user needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I go into full detail on how I’d improve these things in the talk - with code examples and in-depth explanations.</p>\n<h2>Interested in having me give a talk?</h2>\n<p>Please <a href=\"/contact\">contact me</a> with talk opportunities.
