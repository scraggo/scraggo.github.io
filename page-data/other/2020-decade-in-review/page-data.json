If I get a chance to do this, I come up with New Years resolutions afterwards. Some years I go through a somewhat involved process of going through my journal entries and coming up with the best realizations.</p>\n<p>This year, my girlfriend wanted to try Marie Forleoâ€™s recommendation of <a href=\"https://www.marieforleo.com/2019/12/decade-in-review-10-year-plan/\">reviewing the past decade</a>. We went through the exercises together and shared a majority of our writings with each other. During the process I realized that itâ€™s been quite a formative decade!</p>\n<h2>The 2010s</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://scraggo.bandcamp.com\">I released a solo album</a></li>\n<li>I changed careers and have been working professionally as a JavaScript Developer</li>\n<li>I learned how to be a more positive communicator</li>\n<li>Iâ€™m more truthful about what I like and dislike - I donâ€™t need to please others before myself</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2020 Resolutions (and beyond)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Abandon perfection - prioritize and ship projects without getting bogged down</li>\n<li>Declutter my office so that I can focus better</li>\n<li>Do more fun things, work a little less, and exercise</li>\n<li>Take care of my mental health</li>\n<li>Let go of the idea that <em>Iâ€™m not good enough</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>These exercises are really worth doing</h2>\n<p>During the process of working on these exercises, it dawned on me just how awesome it wouldâ€™ve been if I had set up these guideposts for myself in 2010.</p>\n<p>I canâ€™t recommend doing these exercises enough.
