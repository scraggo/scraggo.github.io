Converse with the owner of the repo and have an open mind. (Maybe what you‚Äôre requesting is already available in the library)</li>\n<li>Get buy-in and wait for an explicit invitation to alter the source code.</li>\n<li>Make edits. Write tests and update the documentation.</li>\n<li>Converse, ask questions, follow the style that the maintainers propose.</li>\n<li>Be gracious and thankful!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About <code class=\"language-text\">is</code></h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">is</code> makes checking a type in JavaScript much easier than what‚Äôs built into the language.</p>\n<p>The first example in the README shows how easy it is to use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> is <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'@sindresorhus/is'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function\">is</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'ü¶Ñ'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">//=> 'string'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function\">is</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">//=> 'Map'</span>\n\nis<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">number</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">6</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">//=> true</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/~sindresorhus\">author of this library</a> has created over 1,000 packages that are used by many developers daily. This one in particular has 2,461,210 weekly downloads.</p>\n<h2>The feature I requested</h2>\n<p>One check in particular I find especially useful is <code class=\"language-text\">is.nullOrUndefined(value)</code>. The JS builtin <code class=\"language-text\">!value</code> will consider the number <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> false and I always find myself making relatively verbose handlers for this case.</p>\n<p>I wanted a way to make a union (this type ‚Äúor‚Äù that type) for any number of arbitrary types. I scoured the documentation for this functionality and didn‚Äôt find it. I was able to write a wrapper function that created this functionality and could‚Äôve stopped there, but I didn‚Äôt. I decided to request that this new feature be built into the library.</p>\n<p>I filed this issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/is/issues/98\">https://github.com/sindresorhus/is/issues/98</a></p>\n<p>I showed how I implemented the feature and wrote a simple test case to show its usage.</p>\n<p>The author (<code class=\"language-text\">@sindresorhus</code> himself) wrote back to say that it seemed useful, but didn‚Äôt want to add a new function to the API. He asked if I had thoughts or ideas how to make it work with the existing <code class=\"language-text\">any</code> function.</p>\n<p>I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to actually respond! I shook off my surprise and wrote him back to say that I liked what he proposed but didn‚Äôt want to make it confusing. Didn‚Äôt hear back for a while.</p>\n<p>When he responded, he had ‚Äúthe answer.‚Äù He wrote a quick test case and said ‚ÄúPR welcome for that.‚Äù I was IN!</p>\n<h2>An unfamiliar codebase</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve used TypeScript before, but I‚Äôm pretty inexperienced. Some things I learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\">TypeScript type guards</a></li>\n<li>Linting with <a href=\"https://github.com/xojs/xo\">xo</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/avajs/ava\">testing library Ava</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt feel confident at first, but once I started making changes, I got into the groove.</p>\n<p>Ava was really interesting to work with. The library encourages keeping tests <em>dead simple</em>. It‚Äôs a pleasure to write assertions without complex setup. (I plan on writing more about Ava in a future post.)</p>\n<p>I got the feature to work, wrote a few test cases, and submitted the pull request.</p>\n<h2>The pull request</h2>\n<p>Here it is: <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/is/pull/104\">https://github.com/sindresorhus/is/pull/104</a></p>\n<p>It was scary working with a team of people I‚Äôve never worked with before. They started making comments and code suggestions soon after I made the PR.</p>\n<p>The types part of TypeScript code was challenging for me. There was a good bit of back and forth about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the choice to make a new union type or just inline existing types</li>\n<li>where and when to cast types</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I felt nervous about my responses. Impostor syndrome came out full force. I tried to keep it cool, ask clarifying questions, and a handful of changes later, we were all happy with the result.</p>\n<p>I noticed something that I didn‚Äôt realize was possible: the maintainers can change PR titles and descriptions (and some other things that I wrote originally) as they please. I was fascinated by their changes. It‚Äôs <em>their</em> library, after all, and they <em>should</em> be able to do that to keep the repo history consistent.</p>\n<h2>The release of is@2.1.0</h2>\n<p>It was incredibly rewarding to see that the feature I put in was released shortly after the PR was merged. Use either of these links to learn how to use the library in a project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/is\">https://github.com/sindresorhus/is</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sindresorhus/is\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sindresorhus/is</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had such a great experience. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next time I have the chance to contribute to an awesome, well-maintained open source library.
