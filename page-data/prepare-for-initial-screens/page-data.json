You may have heard that after sending your resume to a company, there’s an initial screen. This is usually done over the phone, but sometimes it happens in-person. Your resume and cover letter (the <em>first</em> impression) surely made a positive impact, but the most important evaluation has yet to come: making a <em>human</em> connection with a company recruiter. They’ll be mentally noting how you speak, your confidence level, how passionate you are, and much more.</p>\n<p>Having done around 28 phone screens, I want to share what I’ve learned from those experiences.</p>\n<p>What I’ll discuss:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preparing and rehearsing responses to common questions</li>\n<li>Types of companies and roles</li>\n<li>What companies value</li>\n<li>*Some of my phone screen experiences*</li>\n<li>Words of motivation: keep going despite the “mistakes”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a lot of potentially difficult things to navigate during phone screens. Oftentimes, you don’t know a whole lot about the company and/or the company doesn’t know much about you. In all likelihood you’ll be nervous. Your voice might start quivering…you’ll hear that and it’ll make you even more nervous! Many times the interviewer will have a “cold” sounding voice and won’t give you much feedback on your responses. These things are all perfectly normal. Being prepared is key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-prepare\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-to-prepare\" aria-label=\"what to prepare permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What to prepare</h2>\n<h3 id=\"a-more-in-depth-statement-about-why-youve-applied-to-their-company\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-more-in-depth-statement-about-why-youve-applied-to-their-company\" aria-label=\"a more in depth statement about why youve applied to their company permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A more in-depth statement about why you’ve applied to their company</h3>\n<p>It’s wise to rehearse these few topics out loud.

You may not get a complete picture from reading the job description. You’ll quickly want to gather a few pieces of information: Two types of companies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Product company:</strong> Prepare thoughts on how you might create scalable, sustainable solutions around one product idea. This might be through creating custom tooling, using pre-built tooling, and multiple repos that solve smaller problems related to the core software.</li>\n<li><strong>Agency</strong>: Prepare thoughts on how you would start projects, how you’d decide the larger architecture, how you enjoy finding the right tools for the job.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>…and three types of roles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Full stack (back end focused)</strong>: Prepare thoughts on correctly creating and organizing databases, algorithms, data structures, etc. You’ll also want to show enthusiasm for the front end.</li>\n<li><strong>Support</strong>: Prepare thoughts on how you’ve communicated ideas to developers and non-developers as well as creating tooling for custom purposes.</li>\n<li><strong>UI/UX</strong>: Prepare thoughts on separation of front end layers like layout, font, API calls, templating, etc as well as making the great experiences for users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you get a chance to ask about any of these up front, go for it!</p>\n<h3 id=\"answers-for-questions-you-dont-have-a-substantial-answer-for\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#answers-for-questions-you-dont-have-a-substantial-answer-for\" aria-label=\"answers for questions you dont have a substantial answer for permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Answers for questions you don’t have a substantial answer for</h3>\n<p>In most interviews, you’ll be asked questions for which you just don’t have a great answer. If you don’t have a lot of experience or aren’t the best with something the recruiter is asking about, here are some ways of replying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I don’t have a lot of experience with (subject) but I would love to learn more about it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“While I haven’t done much with (subject), I have a fair bit of experience with (related subject.)”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I haven’t heard of that, actually. I’m going to look into it after our call.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes, though, just saying “I don’t know” is the right way to go. That <em>last</em> thing you want to do is start making something up or “BS-ing” your way through an answer. That’s a red flag because companies would rather not have people who skirt around issues. Direct and honest communication is the key - writing software is difficult enough as is!</p>\n<h3 id=\"prepare-a-statement-about-your-salary-needs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prepare-a-statement-about-your-salary-needs\" aria-label=\"prepare a statement about your salary needs permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Prepare a statement about your salary needs</h3>\n<p><strong>Some companies will ask your desired salary range in the first conversation!</strong> Given this potentially daunting fact, I recommend first starting your research with these four items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average developer salaries in your area</li>\n<li>Average junior* developer salaries in your area</li>\n<li>Average developer salaries at the company</li>\n<li>Average junior* developer salaries at the company</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>*junior or whatever level you’re at</em></p>\n<p>At the very least, you’ll be prepared with numbers that should seem fair for your area, the company, and the given role.</p>\n<p>This question in particular gave me a lot of anxiety because I didn’t feel like I was yet “worth” a market rate.

A quick evaluation for yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have you built a project (not based on a tutorial) with the specific language or stack?</li>\n<li>Do you have significant experience in a <em>very</em> similar environment and are confident you could pick up the new tech? (Example: the job wants a Vue.js developer, but you’ve only worked in React.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be prepared to explain how your experience fits what they need technically.

Here are the values I’ve found to be the most relevant in evaluating your fit with a company:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Culture fit</strong>: the candidate’s background, personality, style, and/or traits indicate they’ll fit into a unified team.</li>\n<li><strong>Experience</strong>: the candidate has started and finished many large projects. They could do this alone or lead a team. A high level of confidence is required and the company is usually seeking a senior-level engineer.</li>\n<li><strong>General knowledge</strong>: The candidate is able to “see the big picture.” They aren’t stuck in a single mindset, language, or framework. They are very enthusiastic about learning and can do so quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Specific knowledge</strong>: The candidate is an expert in specific tools, methodologies, languages, or frameworks.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay</strong>: The candidate is willing to accept a definite maximum salary. (I’m not kidding - this is a real thing!)</li>\n<li><strong>Client interaction</strong>: The candidate is cool with working with clients, traveling, or other interactive / non-coding duties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"some-of-my-phone-screen-experiences\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#some-of-my-phone-screen-experiences\" aria-label=\"some of my phone screen experiences permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Some of my phone screen experiences</h2>\n<h3 id=\"when-the-culture-fit-was-right\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#when-the-culture-fit-was-right\" aria-label=\"when the culture fit was right permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>When the culture fit was right</h3>\n<p>I have a background as a musician.

I told the recruiter in the initial screen that I had some good experience but I wasn’t necessarily ready to be a team lead. She said “that’s totally fine!” But in the next phone screen with 2 developers, one of them said in a stern voice, “We need someone to lead the team!!!” I definitely fluffed my way through a few of the questions. The onsite didn’t go particularly well - I wasn’t prepared for the vanilla JavaScript challenge they had me do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-i-had-just-the-right-amount-of-experience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#when-i-had-just-the-right-amount-of-experience\" aria-label=\"when i had just the right amount of experience permalink\" class=\"autolink-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>When I had just the right amount of experience</h3>\n<p>My first full-time development job was with a company that put heavy emphasis on candidates completing the onsite code challenge. 3 months into my job search, I’d become much better with doing code challenges in-person.

I said “well, it depends on the role and what else the company can provide.” I then said I could go to maybe 8. He then said “would you take 7?” I said “based on what I previously said, not knowing the role or the company, probably not?

From these, I’ve been made multiple offers and have now worked full-time with two companies. I’m also able to more easily see early indicators of fit. I’ll ask these questions to myself right away:</p>\n<p><em>Do I feel confident about my technical knowledge and experience? Am I excited about the company’s culture and products? Is the phone interview going in such a way that I don’t get the impression that I’m being negatively judged? Possibly most importantly, do I feel like the company will value my contributions and pay me a fair rate?</em></p>\n<p>I realize now that all my “mistakes” during phone screens were all part of learning how to navigate this industry. Sure, I could’ve had better answers. Sure, I could’ve been more targeted about what I was looking for.
