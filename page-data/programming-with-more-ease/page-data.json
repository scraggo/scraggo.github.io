But sometimes I hit a wall. A given challenge can become a problem that I’m frustratingly unable to solve.</p>\n<p>Often, this frustration would spiral into a worse mental state. I’d imagine the problem as a scary, overwhelming, difficult to defeat monster - more difficult than it really is. I’d put <em>a lot</em> of pressure on myself. ”<em>Solving problems is my job</em>”, after all.</p>\n<p>You can probably see that this state of mind that isn’t conducive to problem solving.</p>\n<p>I realized recently that this was happening pretty often. I’d get into a bad mood and be unpleasant to be around - generally having a negative impact on my life.</p>\n<p>In order to stop this madness. I first needed to figure out why it was happening. After, I would create a new mental habit - which I’m calling “Programming with more ease.”</p>\n<p>Getting to the source of my mental hangups wasn’t easy, but essentially, it boils down to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encountering a problem led me to feel like it was somehow my fault that there was a problem in the first place. This indicated a habit of making “problematic things” personal and finding ways to feel guilty about them.</li>\n<li>This problem being “my fault” also meant to me that I should fix it right away. If I can’t do that, then it shows that I’m really not that intelligent and should probably not be in this industry. It’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">impostor syndrome</a> and a tendency to make myself inferior to things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/923f8/impostor-syndrome.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 38.888888888888886%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"impostor syndrome - Wikipedia excerpt\"\n        title=\"impostor syndrome - Wikipedia excerpt\"\n        src=\"/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/799d3/impostor-syndrome.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/00d96/impostor-syndrome.png 148w,\n/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/0b23c/impostor-syndrome.png 295w,\n/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/799d3/impostor-syndrome.png 590w,\n/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/2a3d6/impostor-syndrome.png 885w,\n/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/ae92f/impostor-syndrome.png 1180w,\n/static/3f231a4ce36d39b85f27e9794f7befb1/923f8/impostor-syndrome.png 1656w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>When discovering old, unchecked mental habits I now have a mantra to “rewrite the script.” The old script is to feel guilty and stupid. The new script is to be detached and systematic - patiently working through the problem using the Socratic method and liberally taking breaks.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example that peers into my old mental state.</p>\n<p>A project I’m working on with a friend had an issue with the login form. To fix that immediate issue, I upgraded the 3rd party login provider package. After the upgrade, it revealed a bad way of handling a case where the user email doesn’t come back correctly from the service. I refactored the code a little bit and handled that better. Then I noticed the user account page was “messed up.” There was now an even bigger bug than before. I felt that pang of guilt - I felt like I caused it. I started looking into it - the entire Redux user state was empty. My old script played:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I thought I was fixing this - and here we are. I can’t even use Redux properly.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My mood had tanked and I started the old, desperate “hack and slash” at the problem. Thankfully, my spouse interrupted me with the idea of stopping and taking a walk instead. While talking with her, it dawned on me that I wouldn’t expect anyone I was working with to <em>immediately</em> “know” the answer to this problem - or any problem <em>immediately</em> upon encountering it!</p>\n<p>With my fresh realization, I tried a new mindset. I began with unapologetic detachment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Seems like the state was relying on something that’s no longer happening.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I went on to describe it in disinterested detail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“When I log in, the user state doesn’t have the expected properties…”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then I took a short break. The break allowed my subconscious to work on the problem - happily, this happens more often than not. After coming back, it was Rubber Duck Debug time. The rubber duck is my figurative programming student just learning the ropes. I asked questions in a Socratic manner - not expecting solutions, but probing for possible explanations. My goal was to create a list of the most promising leads and learn what there is to learn.</p>\n<p>“What’s in the network call - is it empty?”</p>\n<p>“What can I discover in the browser debugger?”</p>\n<p>“Who is making the call to the login services?”</p>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>In the end I got to the root cause - the app originally was fetching user data on initial mount, but it really needed to be fetching on an update.</p>\n<p>It’s not like I didn’t know <em>how</em> to debug, I was just putting a lot of stress on myself. That stress would cause “tunnel-vision” and I’d wind up not acting on knowledge I have.</p>\n<p>To summarize my new process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon encountering a problem, describe it in a disinterested manner - no need for a lot of detail.</li>\n<li>Erase blame - it’s not my fault, it’s simply a fact of existence.</li>\n<li>Take a break. Think about something else and allow my subconscious to work on it.</li>\n<li>Be positive. Remind myself that I’ve had many past successes and I can do it. Discovering unwanted behavior is the first step to fixing it.</li>\n<li>Rubber duck debug. Describe the problem in detail, everything I know, and everything I’m assuming.</li>\n<li>Socratic method. Pretend I’m guiding a beginner programmer, asking them questions about assumptions, data flow, and anything else relevant to the problem. (This systematic process often leads to a lightbulb moment where a promising direction for troubleshooting pops into my head.)</li>\n<li>Take another break. Repeat anything above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I cant figure it out, I acknowledge that I’m a human and I either need outside help or to just put the problem away until I know more.</p>\n<p>In conclusion: if you’re at all like me, you might be putting undue pressure on yourself. The process I outlined above has been working for me to alleviate some of this mental pressure. Can you relate?
