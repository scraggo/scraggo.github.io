At a certain point you may wonder how much else you need to know to be able to start working as a programmer. I’m a self-taught coder with experience in web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc) and Python. Compiling some info from job listings has enlightened me to what’s in demand in my area (Chicago, IL, USA) and in general.</p>\n<h2>Python-related Jobs</h2>\n<p>1. Bots (read more on <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-write-a-bot-using-Python\">Quora</a>)</p>\n<p>If you can automate tasks on the web using Mechanize, Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, there are many freelance temp jobs as well as part-time and full-time jobs.</p>\n<p>2. GUIs</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming\">many different GUI frameworks</a> you could learn in Python. Making an effective GUI for a program is always in demand.</p>\n<p>3. Flask, Django, and more</p>\n<p>Flask and Django are the famous Python backend frameworks. Django is used in <a href=\"http://www.bedjango.com/blog/top-5-sites-built-django-framework/\">some well-known websites</a>. I hadn’t heard of <a href=\"http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/\">Tornado</a> and <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/\">Twisted</a> frameworks before looking at job listings, so it may behoove you to have a niche.</p>\n<h2>JavaScript / Web</h2>\n<p>1. JavaScript Frameworks</p>\n<p>React, Angular 2, and Ember seem to be the most requested frameworks in my area. Angular 2 and Ember are full MVC frameworks, while React users will need to add components to get MVC functionality.</p>\n<p>2. Mobile Frameworks</p>\n<p>Ionic is an HTML5 framework which allows you to make mobile apps without using native iOS or Android languages. Ionic needs a native wrapper like Cordova or PhoneGap in order to run as a native app.</p>\n<p>3. CSS Preprocessors and Frameworks</p>\n<p>Sass (.scss) is in demand for its capabilities to write css with variables and other helpful mechanisms. Twitter Bootstrap is excellent for easily designing pages.</p>\n<p>4. Back-end Frameworks</p>\n<p>I’ve seen a lot of listings that use the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON. Express.js is a framework that adds useful web-capabilities to Node. Node is a stand-alone JavaScript engine designed to build scalable network applications. It runs events asynchronously, which enables it to easily handle complex network requests.</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a></p>\n<p>Many companies are using AWS, so it’s worth investigating.</p>\n<p>2. <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/\">Firebase</a></p>\n<p>Google’s Firebase is a full-fledged mobile platform and server.</p>\n<h2>Example Listings: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Apple, Microsoft, Go, and more</h2>\n<p>Below are some anonymous job listings to show examples of what companies are looking for. Many of these require a CS degree or multiple years of experience, but don’t let that deter you from pursuing the professional path.
