I’ve generally struggled to store, organize, and retrieve them effectively. As I was going through my archives recently, it dawned on me that there are two fundamental types of ideas: one is “concrete” and the other is “meta.”</p>\n<p>A concrete idea is specific and actionable. It may be a chord progression like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A minor for two and a half bars, then a G major chord for half a bar. 132 beats per minute, 4/4 time…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I could record it, add some melodies to it, add some other sections, and eventually ship this completed song.</p>\n<p>This post will focus on the other type, the <strong>💡💡meta idea💡💡</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The definition of “meta idea”</li>\n<li>How to act on meta ideas</li>\n<li>Categorization of types of meta ideas</li>\n<li>My meta ideas</li>\n<li>Others’ meta ideas - brief discussion and lots of resources</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What is a “Meta Idea”?</h2>\n<p>A meta idea is an instruction that, if acted on, could generate a concrete idea. Some analogies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s like a 3D printer and its design capabilities</li>\n<li>In the programming world, a meta idea is like an object-oriented <em>class</em>, and the concrete idea is an <em>instantiation</em> of the class. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Objects_and_classes\">Object-oriented programming - Wikipedia</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 460px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/368c7befb41f281a27bc3048cdd1f16d/d5727/meta-ideas.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAADg0lEQVQ4y52U/U9TZxTH75+zLNnP2w/LMpcty15VwhiDicAtLWCRQsEJESggNm6DtryI07C4ZWPGtxYwg1ihyksJKhNkBaWUQktLy4vRyZYoLZ89BdrdhcYfPMk3Pc85537u6XlujoSwra2tHSn9hEjY3tx/z8RNiidiFo1GeRGJbGszEt2VOG/uaFMR36mJbD+jfJmkhL2qKaGSMuCZnaXEaEFVb0E2NJFT00S2UI7BtK2Yny1+5TozsqipbGwjFFz6H1SKOxvrq7x+SI9UeAEppRrpQAVS5mmk41Yk/SWksstI5VeQijuRdEKlF5HU53i/oAI2nydmmQC6pqZ4Y9/HfF55CtnSQdb37WSbzrMvt4iscgNfl1bxruooqtYLZH13Frn5Rz4sqeadz77Av7iQ6DIBnJ6ZoVCj4ZDQsVNGSgy1FNcYOCzL3B0bY2RwkIPp6ZSLnE7Ey042cDhWW6rHu5AEOPlgCjlPw0cpqWSoNXwpq0jNzuWTAymMDA8x0G/n7fc+IEOTT1quTLoqj09T0yjW6XG75/YC709MIqvUnOmzM/TsH3oDIRxPntF42UpaUTWZulrafr+B4+nGdu7WX39jumpFW6jlkbjMPcA/7k8IoAbTtW5uLK9gc8/T5VnAEfJiummldfAqjrCXXq+f2fV1boZWMP7SifZIETMPXwI023qwh1cFzE+f18WSTxbZ14i8UOOcv0TP4gqjy0HGHj/ldOfFlwEnE8BYh11zXnrm5vEun4DnEpsbb+FYcGL1BLC6PfSHVvl2F/jwURLgxOQDcuU8LLbr3H4i5rS0TG9whdtrAYYH32R4uob+tcf0ifnF1B/r8NffOCJmOJvsUv50ucgv0GLuus4P9gExcBvNtm6au+00dFSKv3d222/u6sYscu2ipvHKNXRHdXi9ST4bl2ua/fsPklN+nAJtEW0WCxZTE82mRtpb2sW5RfhNImYSvpnc/HyK6k+S+VUGPp9vL3B8fBxDg5GhO3ewDw5xa3QUx64GnCM4nM5d38nwvXuc/+lnTtTWUVVXhzvZZzMzPYNafwzjuQ5qLK1UmVuoEl1VC1+pWNzQcoZiQz3ZJWVov6nA71d0GF9fEXEIh0IEl5YIBgL4Fn14xC3PiYG7Z3cU8+c9XnwLi6yEw6yvrrK+tpbYp4n1pdy4r2pxhqSkx1pWKtnKj0a3ktbEGf8CIawzA5PVrqwAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Meta Idea Factory\"\n        title=\"Meta Idea Factory\"\n        src=\"/static/368c7befb41f281a27bc3048cdd1f16d/d5727/meta-ideas.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/368c7befb41f281a27bc3048cdd1f16d/00d96/meta-ideas.png 148w,\n/static/368c7befb41f281a27bc3048cdd1f16d/0b23c/meta-ideas.png 295w,\n/static/368c7befb41f281a27bc3048cdd1f16d/d5727/meta-ideas.png 460w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Here are some examples to illustrate what a meta idea is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Write a new jazz melody a day”</li>\n<li>“Start your songwriting process with a drum beat and add parts from there”</li>\n<li>“Read through an old journal entry once a week to get into that mindset and write down your impressions”</li>\n<li>“Listen to an album you like, pick a moment you like, and come up with a variation on that moment”</li>\n<li>“Use a random word/music generator” <a href=\"https://random-music-generators.herokuapp.com/\">like this one</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(There will be <em>a lot</em> more examples later.)</p>\n<p>None of these examples are Top 40 song ideas or best-selling novel ideas. None of them contain artistic content. Your <em>action</em> on them though may lead to creating one!</p>\n<p>Often when someone offers composition and songwriting advice, it’s in the form of meta ideas. There’s really no shortage of these. As with most advice, the power is acting on them, not merely acknowledging them. How do we do that?</p>\n<h2>Acting on Meta Ideas</h2>\n<p>For the naturally creative mind of a child, the creative act is mostly effortless. For adults, a creative flow can be difficult to reliably acquire - for many, it can be blocked entirely (the infamous “writer’s block”).</p>\n<p>The recommendations of great creative minds, like <a href=\"https://sivers.org/book/WarOfArt\">Stephen Pressfield in his “War of Art”</a> will remind us of the “1% inspiration, 99% perspiration” dogma. Put your ass in the chair at the same time every day and “do the work.” I’ve been rebelling against this wisdom for a long time. I thought spontaneous inspiration was the supreme Ideal of idea creation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sivers.org/book/HowToFail\">Scott Adams in “How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life”</a> explains that systems beat ideas. Having a creative habit is better than a single amazing idea.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aside: <a href=\"https://sivers.org/book/\">Derek Sivers’ book summaries</a> are the bomb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given this wisdom and the distinction between meta and concrete ideas - I now separate the creative act into two approaches.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first is simply going with some particular concrete idea if I’m consumed by it at the moment.</li>\n<li>The other is to regularly take advantage of the many meta ideas that are out there (and yet to be created).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can meta ideas be prescriptive or formulaic? Absolutely. Part of the creative process is making something interesting from simple instructions. Another part of the process is making meta ideas personal. Which meta ideas are most inspiring to you? If none, can you come up with some (perhaps by using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYgEfriJsR8\">divergent thinking</a>)? You won’t know unless you put in the work.</p>\n<h2>Categories</h2>\n<p>Here’s a non-exhaustive list of categories in which meta ideas may be classified (with a focus on music):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generator tools - <a href=\"https://random-music-generators.herokuapp.com/\">like this one</a></li>\n<li>Question prompts</li>\n<li>Limits, boundaries, distinctions, confines</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-art (conversations, philosophy, business, news, politics, any domain of human knowledge)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your psychology: dreams, opinions, emotional reactions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Aesthetics in general (simplicity vs complexity, experimental vs conservative)</li>\n<li>Collaboration, Audiences, performers</li>\n<li>Non-music art forms (words, poetry, stories, non-fiction, visual)</li>\n<li>Existing music (which can be used as a springboard)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Music theory concepts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Sonic” - texture, timbre, music-concrete, instrumentations, genres</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My Meta Ideas</h2>\n<p>One beautiful thing about meta ideas is that no one can really copyright them. There’s nothing to steal. They’re basically suggestions. You <em>only</em> get out of them what you put into them. So, I’m happy to share my meta ideas here and will update this page with new ones. (Organizing this list will be an ongoing process.)</p>\n<h3>General / non-music</h3>\n<p>Limits and boundaries. Ideas can come from anywhere. As soon as you define a boundary, you have something to work with. If you’re limited to a very small space, you’re more likely to find some interesting details, rather than taking a large swath of something.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Example: Look through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy</a>. Use the first word that strikes you as an analogy or metaphor in a lyric.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aesthetics - a paraphrased quote from Chef’s Table. Creativity has to be new. Every parameter has to change. Doing what’s been done before isn’t creativity. Is that avant-garde? Or is <em>avant-garde not new anymore?</em></p>\n<p>Getting the creative mind warmed up in other ways</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drawing, painting, sculpture, etc - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">Visual arts - Wikipedia</a></li>\n<li>Acting, standup comedy, improv</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Music</h3>\n<p>Songwriting / lyrical ideas</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyzing dreams - great songwriting material.</li>\n<li>Nassim Taleb. Antifragile, etc. Such good stuff.</li>\n<li>Work on political album. Responses to people. What’s bad. What’s good.

Start with the busiest part of the song. Make it as minimal as possible. Then decompose it to create the rest of the song. add variety as needed.</li>\n<li>Write music for middle school. If you can write music that sounds great and is simple to play, you’ll have a HUGE audience for it.</li>\n<li>Any simple melody, harmony, or rhythm could have an interesting counterpart.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Melody</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DON’T follow tendency tones. They make my melodies too predictable. (and write a post about “What I Had to unlearn from music school”.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arrange it Yourself</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a bunch of old, unfinished ideas? What if you put the work on the performers to arrange the idea? What I’d provide is 1-2 pages of description and original guitar tab / notation. Can include suggested scales, form, instrumentation, tempi, song or artist influences. As many piano staves as necessary. Performers wing it or prepare something. Record it. Give them credit. Give prizes to the best arrangements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pitch classes are merely structural guide tones.</p>\n<p>I want to make “bored” music. Why should music have to be “emotional” all the time? I just want to write my music and get it over with. If people don’t like it, who cares?</p>\n<p>Check on Evernote - got a lot of writings I haven’t looked at in a while.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sometimes just looking over old ideas is inspiring. Why don’t I schedule that and do it regularly?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Write songs with fewer choruses or none at all.</p>\n<p>Ginastera.

Duh! Why didn’t I think of that 10 years ago?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An album called Mistakes and All. All improvs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Write serial jazz. Has it been done before?
