For many years, I've consistently written down tiny ideas and have tried to store, organize, and retrieve them. Having more time recently to go through them, the need for a distinction dawned on me. There are fundamentally two types of ideas: one is "concrete" and the other is "meta."

A concrete idea is specific and actionable. It may be a chord progression like:

> A minor for two and a half bars, then a G major chord for half a bar. 132 beats per minute, 4/4 time...

I could record it, add some melodies to it, add some other sections, and eventually ship this completed song.

This post will focus on the other type, the **üí°üí°meta ideaüí°üí°**.

1. The definition of "meta idea"
2. Discussion on how to meta ideas
3. Categories of meta ideas
4. I'll share a huge number of my meta ideas
5. I'll provide links to others' meta ideas

## What is a "Meta Idea"?

A meta idea is an instruction that, if acted on, could generate a concrete idea. Some analogies:

- It‚Äôs like the software and hardware equipment in a plastic manufacturing factory that could be configured to shape plastic into just about anything. Or a 3D printer.
- In the programming world, a meta idea is like an object-oriented _class_, and the concrete idea is an _instantiation_ of the class. [Object-oriented programming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Objects_and_classes)

Here are some examples to illustrate what a meta idea is:

- ‚ÄúWrite a new jazz melody a day‚Äù
- ‚ÄúStart your songwriting process with a drum beat and add parts from there‚Äù
- "Read through an old journal entry once a week to get into that mindset and write down your impressions"
- "Listen to an album you like, pick a moment you like, and come up with a variation on that moment"
- "Use a random word/music generator"
  - [random music generators](https://random-music-generators.herokuapp.com/)

(There will be _a lot_ more examples later.)

None of these examples are Top 40 songs or best-selling novels. None of them contain artistic content. Your _action_ on them may lead to creating one!

When someone offers composition and songwriting advice, a lot of time it's in the form of meta ideas. There's really no shortage of these. With most advice, the power is acting on them, not merely acknowledging them. How do we do that?

## Acting on Meta Ideas

The creative act is a confounding thing. The innocent mind of a child has no trouble generating a multitude of ideas. Effortlessly - unquestionably obvious to the uninhibited child. As soon as you try to define the creative process and use it productively, it often drifts away and stays just out of reach. It can be confounding to study, and for many it's blocked by psychological inhibitions.

The recommendations of great creative minds, like [Stephen Pressfield in his "War of Art"](https://sivers.org/book/WarOfArt) will remind us of the "1% inspiration, 99% perspiration" dogma. Put your ass in the chair at the same time every day and "do the work." I've been rebelling against this wisdom for a long time. I thought spontaneous inspiration was the supreme Ideal of idea creation.

Thinking more clearly about it, I realized I need to separate the creative act into two essential pieces. If I'm consumed by some particular concrete idea, I'm going to go with it. If not, there are just too many meta ideas to make excuses anymore. [Scott Adams in "How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life"](https://sivers.org/book/HowToFail) explains that systems beat ideas. Having a creative habit is better than a single amazing idea.

Can meta ideas be prescriptive or formulaic? Absolutely. Part of the creative process is making something interesting from simple instructions. Another part of the process is making meta ideas personal. Which meta ideas are most inspiring to you? If none, can you come up with some (perhaps by using [divergent thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYgEfriJsR8))? You won't know unless you put in the work.

> Aside: [Derek Sivers' book summaries](https://sivers.org/book/) are the bomb.

## Categories

Here I propose some categories in which meta ideas may be classified:

- Non-art (conversations, philosophy, business, news, politics)
  - your psychology: dreams, opinions, emotional reactions
- Non-music art forms (words, poetry, stories, non-fiction, visual)
  - Aesthetics in general (simplicity vs complexity, experimental vs conservative)
- Generator tools
- Question prompts
- Limits, boundaries, distinctions, confines
- Existing music as a springboard
- Music theory concepts
  - "Sonic" - texture, timbre, music-concrete, instrumentations, genres
- Collaboration, Audiences, performers
- Something NOT here, not immediately categorizable

## My Meta Ideas

One beautiful thing about meta ideas is that no one can really copyright them. There's nothing to steal. They're basically suggestions. You _only_ get out of them what you put into them. So, I'm happy to share them here and will update this page with new ones.

(This list isn't organized in a great way, but hopefully it's useful. I do plan on continuously elaborating on these and adding new ideas over time.)

### 2020

Limits and boundaries. Ideas can come from anywhere. As soon as you define a boundary, you have something to work with. If you‚Äôre limited to a very small space, you‚Äôre more likely to find some interesting details, rather than taking a large swath of something.

- Example: Look through <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy>. Use the first word that strikes you as an analogy or metaphor in a lyric.

Guitar

- Alternate tuning
- Playing mostly on the lower strings

Music Theory

- Bitonality

Jazz

- write a new melody for existing chords (or vice versa)

Arrange it Yourself

- Have a bunch of old, unfinished ideas? What if you put the work on the performers to arrange the idea? What I'd provide is 1-2 pages of description and original guitar tab / notation. Can include suggested scales, form, instrumentation, tempi, song or artist influences. As many piano staves as necessary. Performers wing it or prepare something. Record it. Give them credit. Give prizes to the best arrangements.

Subtractive composition. Start with the busiest part of the song. Make it as minimal as possible. Then decompose it to create the rest of the song. add variety as needed.

### 2019

Songwriting ideas

- use [random music generators](https://random-music-generators.herokuapp.com/) (shameless plug)
- Negative harmony (just google/duckduckgo/ecosia it.)
- Sample my favorite moments from Schoenburg pieces:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voyLno0HdoA

### 2018

My additions to [Variation Techniques for Composers and Improvisors - 2002 - Larry J. Solomon](https://dokumen.site/download/variation-techniques-for-composers-and-improvisors-a5b39ef889e368)

Melody:

- Echo - second voice repeats shortly after the first
- Register - theme in bass, or other voice shift
- Rhythmic Displacement - starting on a different beat or subdivision
- Function Change - melody becomes background

Harmony & Accompaniment

- mode areas: changing a key or mode (parallel or relative, natural/melodic//harmonic minor) with form (see modulation)

Rhythm

- stylistic - altering the rhythmic feel of a melody or piece to be "straight," "swing," or "latin," etc.

Texture

Tonality

Voicing

- sets - using serial trichords, tetrachords, etc. example: the famous `[0,1,4]` trichord
- jazz voicing ideas:
  - shell voicing - root, third, seventh (no fifth, can omit root)
  - extensions - add 9th, 11th, 13th, etc.
  - quartal - 1, 4, b7, b10, b13, etc, the "So What" chord
  - quintal - 1, 5, 9, 13 etc
  - parallelism - chromatic or diatonic
  - locked hands/tonicization - alternating a sixth chord with a diminished 7th chord diatonically
  - octave changes - drop 2, drop 4, drop 2+4,etc
  - multiple functions - the "Jim Hall" chord: 1, #4, 7, 10, b13
  - reharmonization

Color

Dynamics

Form

- Juxtaposition - Stravinsky‚Äôs musical organization as a ‚Äúblock structure‚Äù and that ‚Äúwithin such a framework, two or more blocks of relatively heterogeneous content are repeatedly and often abruptly juxtaposed.‚Äù
- Traditional Forms: Binary, Ternary, Rondo, Theme+Variations, Sonata, Fugue, Passacaglia, etc

### 2017

Melody writing / Composition

- DON'T follow tendency tones. They make my melodies too predictable. (and write a post about "What I Had to unlearn from music school".)
- Write music for middle school. If you can write music that sounds great and is simple to play, you'll have a HUGE audience for it.
- Any simple melody, harmony, or rhythm could have an interesting counterpart.

Other art forms

- Drawing - getting the creative mind warmed up in other ways

Work on political album. Responses to people. What's bad. What's good. Stream of consciousness.

### 2016

Instrumental album called information overload

Pitch classes are merely structural guide tones.

I want to make ‚Äúbored‚Äù music. Why should music have to be ‚Äúemotional‚Äù all the time? I just want to write my music and get it over with. If people don‚Äôt like it, who cares?

album idea: songs about over-achievement, being compulsive about impressing people

groove album - all instrumental, get a jazz-expert to help me turn them into song forms with melodies and interesting sections

Play my girlfriend some old songs, see what she thinks

Got interesting results with a student by choosing from a list of random chord qualities, and random root notes.

Do jazz covers of rock songs

Check on Evernote - got a lot of writings I haven't looked at in a while.

What to do with "improvs" - turn them into classical guitar pieces. Duh! Why didn't I think of that 10 years ago?

An album called Mistakes and All. All improvs.

Find musicians that want to be record A LOT of music. Quantity, just excited about making music.

Meetup idea: recording musicians who can trade their services

- <http://www.meetup.com/Home-Recorders-Mixers/>

Write songs with fewer choruses or none at all. Imagine you're playing for a small group of friends.

Write serial jazz. Has it been done before? How does one go about doing that?

Ginastera. List of tone rows Wiki +Composition

Analyzing dreams - great songwriting material.

Nassim Taleb. Antifragile, etc. Such good stuff.

Chefs table / Aesthetics. Creativity has to be new. Every parameter has to change. Doing what's been done before isn't creativity. Is that avant-garde? Or is _avant-garde not new anymore?_
