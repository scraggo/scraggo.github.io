_Why start a composition with a blank slate? Jam on a cover tune then take it in a different direction._

Sometimes, the less experience you have figuring out songs, the better. When I was first learning guitar and had much less skill, I tried to figure out songs that I heard. I was usually unsuccessful at transcribing them accurately, but there were many occasions that I enjoyed what I was playing (despite it being wrong) and wrote a song based on it. I call that **Serendipity**.

## What is "serendipity?"

This is where a composer stumbles on a cool sounding idea without even intending to do so. I believe that the act of "trying" often defeats the purpose, especially for a songwriter. So, in this video lesson, I'm going to play some well-known riffs wrong - intentionally. Then I'm going to mess with them - repeat just one part of the riff, invert the intervals, change the rhythm, and other compositional devices that I encourage you to try yourself.

## My starting points

I chose songs from the following 5 decades as my starting points: the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and 2000's. Can you identify what songs I'm using?

_A word of <span style="color: #ff0000;">CAUTION</span>: Make sure your idea is different enough from your inspiration to avoid getting sued over copyright issues!_

## Compositional devices

As an exercise to the student, can you pick out how I'm changing the music that I'm using as a starting point? In future lessons, I will talk in more detail about variation techniques and how to use them in your songs.
