## The Keys to Simplicity

### Selecting a mood / topic for the song

The central theme of your song can come from anywhere - your mood, the news, or a conversation you heard while at a coffee shop. After choosing something, stay in that mindset until you find the need for a well-placed and meaningful contrast.

**It's important to capture your ideas as you create them by recording and/or writing them down.**

### Choose a musical direction by planning ahead.

Now we can begin to create/refine germs of both musical and lyrical ideas. Then, you can play/improvise to find the mood and tempo.

### Analyze what you've played

Ideas evolve by intelligently asking how to serve the original idea. This allows you to generate more ideas based on what you have.

### Are you adding to the meaning or making it unclear?\*\*

Always ask "Do I like it? Is it "filler?" Constantly shape your song by refining the message, not intentionally being "different" or obfuscating the point.

### Interest can be created without intentionally bending the rules.

While getting used to this process, there's no need to stray from tried-and-true methods of writing a song.

### Plug into song forms and lyric templates.

When you use forms and templates, it leads to songwriting that is easily followed by a listener. I will discuss the following in great detail, but for now, refer to [Graham English Speed Songwriting Course](https://speedsongwriting.com/about/) for the following:

- Rhyme Schemes
- Where your title fits in
- Point of View: 1st, 2nd, 3rd person

### Knowledge of Diatonic Music Theory

Knowing the difference between major and minor helps serve the message of the song. There are other modes besides these 2 that we'll explore later. You can change keys globally and locally to add complexity, but only if that serves the song's central message.

### Your foundation depends on simplicity.

It's easy to fall in love with bending the rules for it's own sake (as evidenced by my own stylistic quirks), but you can write a great song by remaining simple in your message and form.
