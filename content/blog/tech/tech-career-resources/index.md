Did you just graduate from a coding bootcamp, obtain a CS degree, or built an involved side project? How do you know when you're ready to write software professionally?

This post is a collection of resources I've found or made that will help you on your job search. There are many questions to answer that are specific to your situation and what you're looking for. Are you trying to work front end, back end, or both? Would you prefer to be at a startup, an agency, or a larger company?

Once you know the answers to these and more questions, there are many roads to finding job opportunities that are a fit for you. It's ultimately up to you to decide your path and these resources can help clarify it.

### Technical questions

- Code Review - If someone were reviewing your code, what would you like them to address? What are the most effective ways to deliver feedback?
- Pair Programming - Do you feel comfortable pairing with another developer? This could be whiteboarding and discussing ideas or coding out loud on a given problem.

### Past projects

### Networking - what's effective?
