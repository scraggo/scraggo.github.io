This post is a pointer to an [article I completed recently](https://github.com/scraggo/comparing-javascript-test-runners) - a comprehensive comparison of the AVA, Jest, Mocha, and `mocha-parallel-tests` JavaScript test runners.

To generate the speed metrics in the article, I created a node application (part of this repo) that runs tests in all the frameworks listed above. [See the repo and documentation](https://github.com/scraggo/comparing-javascript-test-runners/).

## Article Preview

Three test runners have risen far above the rest as the most popular choices of JavaScript test runners:

- AVA
- Jest
- Mocha

\*We'll also be exploring a wrapper for Mocha called `mocha-parallel-tests`.

The immediate practical goal of this article is to help you choose a JavaScript testing framework. My aim is to address the following questions:

**How does one choose the right testing framework for their use case? What criteria should one base their decision on?**

In order to do this, we'll explore some general principles regarding both testing frameworks and testing in general. Then, after outlining the criteria for evaluating the frameworks, we can explore them in detail...
