I really enjoy reflecting on the past year during the holidays. If I get a chance to do this, I come up with New Years resolutions afterwards. Some years I go through a somewhat involved process of going through my journal entries and coming up with the best realizations.

This year, my girlfriend wanted to try Marie Forleo's recommendation of [reviewing the past decade](https://www.marieforleo.com/2019/12/decade-in-review-10-year-plan/). We went through the exercises together and shared a majority of our writings with each other. During the process I realized that it's been quite a formative decade!

## The 2010s

- [I released a solo album](https://scraggo.bandcamp.com)
- I changed careers and have been working professionally as a JavaScript Developer
- I learned how to be a more positive communicator
- I'm more truthful about what I like and dislike - I don't need to please others before myself

## 2020 Resolutions (and beyond)

- Abandon perfection - prioritize and ship projects without getting bogged down
- Declutter my office so that I can focus better
- Do more fun things, work a little less, and exercise
- Take care of my mental health
- Let go of the idea that _I'm not good enough_

## These exercises are really worth doing

During the process of working on these exercises, it dawned on me just how awesome it would've been if I had set up these guideposts for myself in 2010.

I can't recommend doing these exercises enough. Check them out ðŸ‘‰ <https://www.marieforleo.com/2019/12/decade-in-review-10-year-plan/>
