## 2020 and Earlier

Breath by James Nestor - This book is filled with great tips, exercises, and anecdotes. Breathing exclusively through my nose has been a game-changer for sleep, singing, and more. <https://www.mrjamesnestor.com/breath>

Eastern Body, Western Mind by Anodea Judith <https://www.amazon.com/Eastern-Body-Western-Mind-Psychology/dp/1587612259>

It’s Not Always Depression by Hilary Jacobs Hendel - The author teachers the "Change Triangle" methodology for processing emotions, calming, etc. <https://www.hilaryjacobshendel.com/itsnotalwaysdepressionbook>

The Surrender Experiment by Michael Singer: A much needed perspective shift. Why expecting reality to conform to your desires is a guaranteed path to disappointment. Instead, saying yes to opportunities presented to you and learning to be neutral (or even happy) about events you normally would be displeased with. Author is very much into meditation and being in touch with your higher mind / deeper self.

Focusing by Eugene Gendlin - In the same vein as It’s Not Always Depression. I really like the terminology the author uses. <https://focusing.org/sixsteps> <https://www.amazon.com/Focusing-Eugene-T-Gendlin/dp/0553278339>

Essays by Dean Schlecht - <https://www.deanschlecht.com/> In addition to the essays, this psychotherapist provides meditation audio files that put your "active imagination" (a concept accredited to Carl Jung) to use.
