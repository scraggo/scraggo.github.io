questions-for-self-knowledge

## Intro

The words ["Know Thyself"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself) were inscribed long ago in the Greek Temple of Apollo. I consider those wise words because knowing one's self is invaluable in so many areas of life.

The problem is, it's tricky to really understand yourself. Life is full of twists and turns, we don't necessarily have the time or willingness to self-reflect. If you're like me, you also might have a [tendency to deny your own wants and needs for the sake of fitting in](https://calvinrosser.com/notes/wanting-power-of-mimetic-desire-luke-burgis/).

I got to wondering if there was a _targeted_ way to get to know myself. Something less haphazard than reflecting on troubling events, or following some online list of "12 awesome journal prompts." As a psychology enthusiast, I wondered if I could take a bunch of tests and get a somewhat detailed "picture" of who I am.

I had taken a handful of personality tests throughout the years and found the results of the tests to be helpful to learn about myself and others. So, I set out to answer:

1. "Is taking a bunch of personality tests effective for gaining self-knowledge?"
2. "Which tests are the best at helping me learn about myself?"

After many many hours of taking online tests, reflecting on the results, comparing their effectiveness, and reflecting from lots of different angles, I was satisfied. Yes the tests are effective, but you have to do some work to put the bigger "picture" together.

So, let's get to it. This post contains my curated list of internet questionnaires, my own lists of questions, and lots of suggestions to help you put the pieces together.

### The process

1. Answer a _bunch_ of questions.
2. Reflect on the answers. I'll go into detail in the final sections on how to get the most out of your answers.

**Warning**: Having the support of a mental health professional is recommended, especially for tests that explore emotions, trauma, and other sensitive topics.

**Disclaimer**: This post is for entertainment purposes only. There's no guarantee of scientific or other validity from any of these tests.

Suggestions:

- For all tests, store _all_ the text from online results (copying or PDF), links to the tests/results, any questions that were difficult to answer, and other info in your personal notes collection. (See [my post on Building a Second Brain](/building-my-second-brain))
- Create dated journal entries and write answers to non-quiz questions, your reflections on test results, and all other related thoughts.
- Use or create a "spam" email address for the websites that require email.
- Use ad-blocker(s). Unfortunately, at least one online test didn't work in Firefox - you might want Chrome installed just in case.

### The areas of self

The categories of "self" I've chosen are drawn from multiple sources:

- The 10 areas of the Wheel of Life (we'll go into detail in the _Initial Self Inventory_ section)
- Personality Tests
- Strengths and Weaknesses
- Play, Politics, Art, Career, and Finance
- The 5 areas of SPIRE: Spiritual, Physical, Intellectual, Relational, and Emotional. (From [Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar's book _Happier, No Matter What_](https://talbenshahar.com/books/))

## Initial Self Inventory

This first section will get you thinking about the many aspects of your life including some psychological assessments of your satisfaction with life.

### Starting to get to know you

1\. Write down what you know about yourself.

This could be a stream of consciousness - no particular order or deep effort is necessary. Any topic or source of questions is fine.

Answer any/all of the following questions:

- Likes and dislikes: food, music, movies, games, etc
- What forms of exercise or sports do you enjoy?
- Goals and hopes for the future: what have you been working towards - what motivates you to work on that?
- What's a happy memory from childhood/adulthood? Troubled memories?
- Do you have weird dreams?
- What makes you angry / what gets on your nerves?
- Do you have a sense of humor? What's it like?
- Who's your best friend? What do you admire about them?
- How would your coworkers or colleagues describe you?
- Are you introverted or extroverted? Do you enjoy being alone?
- What are your political leanings?
- What are your spiritual beliefs?
- What's your astrological sign?
- What are your strengths and weaknesses? What academic subjects do you enjoy and which do you dislike?
- Family - wealth, encouragement. Neighbors and community. Societal beliefs of the day.
- _Depending on how old you are_: How have you changed since you were a child, teenager, early adult, late 20's, early 30's, etc

2\. Based on the above, write a profile about yourself.

Pretend that you're writing an advertisement to make new friends. Given your interests, What kind of person are you? Do you attempt to categorize yourself? Do you see conflicting traits? Are you straightforward or a complex being?

3\. Keep your answers available to reference later.

After answering any questions below, check your answers against this list. Did you learn something new (plot twist!)? Did you disagree with anything - did something seem accurate or inaccurate? Did the result seem so generic it could apply to anyone?

In the final section of this post, I will suggest doing this referencing (what I call _cross-analysis_) between all the sets of questions.

### Satisfaction with life and the Wheel of Life

Both of the following assessments are provided by <https://positivepsychology.com/life-satisfaction-scales/>

1\. Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)

Are you satisfied with life or is there room for improvement? This short, 5 question assessment as described by [positivepsychology.com](https://positivepsychology.com/life-satisfaction-scales/):

> has been developed to help you get a sense of your satisfaction with your life as a whole. Although the questionnaire doesn't measure individual components, it can be an excellent starting point, encouraging deeper thought and exploration of the specific areas of life that may be causing you a sense of dissatisfaction.

The 5 questions and how to interpret them are available here: <https://positivepsychology.com/life-satisfaction-scales/>

- [Read more - from the authors of the scale: Ed Diener, Robert A. Emmons, Randy J. Larsen and Sharon Griffin as noted in the 1985 article in the _Journal of Personality Assessment_](https://labs.psychology.illinois.edu/~ediener/SWLS.html).

2\. Wheel of Life

> Once you have your score from the SWLS, you can then begin to reflect more fully on where you might like to make changes to build a greater sense of life satisfaction.
>
> This tool will help you do that, as it requires that you identify the different life domains that are important to you - such as career, family, and relationships - and to then give each of these individual domains a rating from 1 to 10, with 1 being "not at all satisfied" and 10 being "completely satisfied."

- [Download The-Wheel-of-Life.pdf](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Wheel-of-Life.pdf) (provided by positivepsychology.com)

Interpreting these:

- Once you have your SWLS score and you've evaluated each life area, you can choose to spend more or less time and effort on the question sets below related to those life areas. This is just the beginning!

## Personality Tests

These tests provide starting places to help you begin to define this broad thing known as your "personality." Psychologists have attempted to determine which traits best define us and are most stable throughout our lives. The tests below can provide valuable insights into our selves, some of the benefits including:

- Understanding our strengths and weaknesses which can help you choose a career path
- Highlighting traits that may cause imbalances. For example: do you tend to prioritize the needs of others over your own?
- Relate better to others:
  - Recognize your communication style(s) to enhance relationships
  - Have insights into others' personalities
- Make life decisions that align better with your values and preferences

### General: Big 5 and Myers-Briggs

1\. The Big 5 (OCEAN) Personality Test

This test is well-regarded in terms of scientific validity. It evaluates

> five broad dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
> These traits might influence how individuals behave in social situations, with extraversion and agreeableness affecting sociability and cooperativeness, while conscientiousness relates to organization and reliability.
> Unlike the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes personality into distinct types, the Big Five traits offer a spectrum of characteristics that can help explain tendencies such as mood swings and varying responses to different social and environmental contexts.

Interpreting your results:

- "I thought I was more/less introverted" - take [this extroversion/introversion test from psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/personality/extroversion-introversion-test) and compare your results.
- "I don't like one or more of my traits" - this is normal. Consult a mental health professional to explore your results. You can read more and take related tests deepen your understanding.

2\. Myers-Briggs

One of the most well-known personality tests, the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](https://www.16personalities.com) proposes 16 personality types, each associated with an arrangement of 4 letters:

- I/E - introvert/extrovert
- N/S - intuitive/sensing
- T/F - thinking/feeling
- J/P - judging/perceiving

Example personality types include ["The Architect" (INTJ)](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality), ["The Campaigner" (ENFP)](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality), and ["The Adventurer" (ISFP)](https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality)

While [criticized as inaccurate and characterized as pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Accuracy_and_validity), it's a fun test to take and compare with friends.

Interpreting your results:

- "I'm in the middle - what does it mean?" - If you're half "J" and half "P", for instance, that might be an area of conflict or you may be very flexible depending on the situation. It's a good opportunity for reflection.

### Motivations: Color Mode and Enneagram

These tests attempt to show your personality through the lens of your motivations.

If you like these questions, you may also like the motivation questions in the Emotional Self section.

1\. Color Mode

This test posits that there are four personality types categorized by colors.

From <https://taylorhartman.com/assessment-information/>:

> Unlike other personality profiles, The Color Code not only identifies what you do but why you do it, allowing you to gain much deeper and more useful insights into what makes you and those around you tick. The Color Code Personality Profile is unique for several reasons. First, it goes deeper than mere personality - it identifies Motive - why you do what you do.

The Colors:

> - Red - **Power** - results and productivity. They bring great gifts of vision and leadership. Reds are generally characterized as responsible, decisive, proactive and assertive.
> - Blue - **Intimacy**, connecting, creating quality relationships and having a purpose is what drives these people. Their natural gifts include quality and service. Blues can be counted on to be loyal, sincere, and thoughtful.
> - White - **Peace**, or the absence of conflict, is what motivates a White. Clarity and tolerance are White gifts. Whites are also known for their qualities of kindness, adaptability, and patience.
> - Yellow - **Fun** - The joy of living in the moment and doing something just for the sake of doing it is the driving force for these people. Yellows offer the gifts of enthusiasm and optimism. They are generally charismatic, spontaneous, and sociable.

Caveat: [Doesn't have scientific backing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman_Personality_Profile). Entertainment purposes only.

Take the test at [mypersonalitystyle.com](https://mypersonalitystyle.com/app/Questionnaires/ColorCode/Play?embed=true) or [colorcode.com](https://www.colorcode.com/free_personality_test/)

Interpreting your results:

- "I could fit more than one of these. Maybe even all of them." Consider yourself multi-colored. _Rank yourself_ and reflect on the circumstances each color would arise. For example, maybe you're mostly blue and white, yellow coming third, and red coming fourth.

2\. Enneagram

[Enneagram of Personality - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality)

According to the authors of this popular assessment, there are 9 personality types. Each type has a set of positive and negative motivations - specifically _ego fixations_, _holy ideas_, _passions_, and _virtues_. To give you an idea, the first 3 are:

> 1. **The Reformer** - seeks integrity and fears being corrupt or defective.
> 2. **The Helper** - seeks love and fears being unloved or unwanted.
> 3. **The Achiever** - seeks value and fears being worthless.

### Fun: Sense of Humor and Play

1\. Sense of Humor

The situations in which you try to make jokes and your style of humor can tell you many things about yourself. The 4 social functions include:

1. Affiliative: Bonding with others
2. Self-enhancement: Feel better about oneself
3. Aggressive: Deliver a harsh or controversial message
4. Self-defeating: Getting others to like you

The [Quiz: What Is Your Sense of Humor? In 10 Types of Humor - Quiz Expo](https://www.quizexpo.com/what-is-your-sense-of-humor/) will help you determine the above and your humor type/style: , _Slapstick_, _Deadpan, _Self-deprecating_, _Potty_, _Topical & Satrical_, _Irony_, _Parody_, _Dark_, or _Surreal_.

2\. Your Play Personality

Pioneered by Dr Stuart Brown, the [Play Personalities test](https://lindsaybraman.com/adult-play-styles/#quiz) can help you determine your "play style." How did you interact with the world when you were a child? What modes of play naturally bring you joy and excitement? Are you a _Joker_, _Kinesthetic_, _Explorer_, _Competitor_, _Director_, _Collector_, _Storyteller_, and/or _Creator_?

Knowing your play style(s) as an adult is useful - more than you may realize. Ali Abdaal, in [his book _Feel Good Productivity_](https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/), makes this suggestion when confronted with a daunting or unappealing task:

> Try asking yourself "What this would look like if it were fun?"

Interpreting your results:

- I recommend taking the quiz twice - once to find your dominant play personality and a second time to notice other areas of interest. Make a ranked list of all the personalities. It's definitely possible to have _more than one play personality_.

### Everything Else: Divination and Just for fun

1\. Divination: While they have no scientific backing, these ancient personality profiles are popular and fun to think about.

- Your astrological birth chart: in addition to your sun sign, there are signs in the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, etc positions at the time of your birth. Make yours: [ASTROLABE: Free Natal Chart / Horoscope](https://alabe.com/freechart/)

2\. Just for fun

- "Which character are you?" quizzes. My favorite is the _Adventure Time_ quiz. You can easily find quizzes for numerous shows, books, movies, etc.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

When we know our strengths and understand our shortcomings, it can really help us choose a suitable career, amongst other things:

> The process of identifying and utilizing your strengths in everyday life has been linked to an elevated sense of vitality and motivation, increased probability of achieving goals, and a stronger sense of life direction. It has also been linked to higher self-confidence, engagement, and productivity.

Tips for interpreting results (recommended by [high5test.com](https://test.high5test.com/)):

- Strengths 1-5: These are your most powerful strengths. Focus on these for professional success and personal happiness.
- Strengths 6-10: Leverage these strengths as needed.
- Strengths 11-15: These traits don't come as naturally to you but you can learn to navigate situations by involving your top strengths.
- Strengths 16-20: You aren't as strong in these areas, but you can delegate. Find a partner or teammate to help in these areas.

2\. DIY approach:

Read [Personal Strengths Defined - positivepsychology.com](https://positivepsychology.com/what-are-your-strengths) in depth. Reflect on the list of traits and rank each one on a scale from 1 to 5. Remember:

> With personal strengths comes the balance of personal weaknesses, and the same is true with mental strength. If not practiced in alignment with personal strengths or without purpose, mental strength may change into its negative counterpart:
>
> - Adaptability can become fickleness.
> - Endurance may lead to martyrdom or victimization.
> - Steadfastness can turn to inflexibility.
> - Dependability can become predictability.
> - Effectiveness may lead to laziness or taking shortcuts.
>
> Being aware of this can help you to adjust where you notice an imbalance. Just as you might go to the gym to build physical muscle and give up bad habits to meet personal fitness goals, you can develop better mental strength through the right mix of behaviors and thoughts.

- _The Socialite_ - Fun-focused and generous with others

## Political Self

Where do you stand on political issues? What role should government play in maintaining societal order and economic restrictions? Some of these questions may be difficult to answer, but they're worthwhile to reflect on.

If you're like me, there will be more than a few questions that challenge you. For instance, where do you stand on compulsory education? Or:

> - Thinking about increased trade of goods and services between the U.S. and other nations in recent decades, would you say that the U.S. has... gained or lost?
> - Overall, would you say people who are convicted of crimes in this country serve… too much / too little / the right amount of time in prison

Out of the handful of tests I took, [mapmypolitics.org](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/quiz.html) is the most comprehensive. The first mapping it provides is where you stand on the spectrums of _economic equality_ and _social freedom_. All the political profiles are represented in this (crude version of their) 2-dimensional grid:

||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Communist | | Fascist | | Paleoconservative |
| State Socialist | Populist | | Neoconservative | Paleolibertarian |
| Democratic Socialist | Liberal | Centrist | Conservative | Neoliberal  |
| Libertarian Socialist | Social Libertarian | | Libertarian | Minarchist |
| Utopian Socialist | | Anarchist | | Anarcho-Capitalist |

- From left to right: economic equality (most to least)
- From bottom to top: social freedom (most to least)

To orient you and give you an idea what your result could be:

- Top Left: [Communism](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/communist.html)
- Top Right: [Paleoconservative](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/paleoconservative.html)
- Bottom Left: [Utopian Socialist](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/utopian-socialist.html)
- Bottom Right: [Anarcho-Capitalist](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/anarcho-capitalist.html)

The quiz also determines where you stand on [military](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/military.html), [environmental]((https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/green.html)), and [deficit (debt spending)](https://www.mapmypolitics.org/ideology/deficit.html) issues.

## Spiritual Self

### Initial spiritual questions

- What's your relationship to religion/spirituality?
- What's your immediate family's relationship to religion/spirituality?
- What are your thoughts on _God_ - is there a God, higher being, divine creator?
- Have you studied multiple other religions and religious paradigms? Where do you stand on pagan, monotheistic, Eastern (Buddhism, Taoism, etc), pantheism, etc?
- Can/does science and spirituality work together?

Evaluate your spiritual practices:

8. How often do you connect with nature or the universe?
9. How often do you practice rituals (including prayer, use of spiritual objects like crystals, tarot cards, etc)?
10. How often do you donate to or volunteer to help those in need?

[This Test Will Reveal What Your Subconscious Mind is Hiding - LonerWolf](https://lonerwolf.com/subconscious-mind-test/) - Your subconscious mind houses tons of material - memories, skills, feelings, ideas, and more. Usefully, it carries out actions on autopilot and helps us make decisions. On the "dark" side, it also holds unresolved feelings and suppressed desires that we don't necessarily want to face.

- There are four primary, insatiable human desires:
  - The desire for acquiring objects (things)
  - Rivalry with others
  - Vanity - fame, recognition
  - Power - wanting to dominate or win
- There's a secondary desire, to have excitement in whatever form

#### Silent Assumptions - Core emotional beliefs

**Having the support of a mental health professional is recommended if you're exploring this area.**

In Chapter 10 of _Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy_ by David M. Burns, the author points to _Silent assumptions_ as "The Cause of it All".

_Silent assumptions_ are our below-conscious determinations of personal worth and value system definitions. They manifest as patterns that drive our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. These assumptions can be based on negative themes such as perfectionism, entitlement, omnipotence, or autonomy.

The goal of the quiz (an abbreviated _Dysfunctional Attitude Scale_) is to expose these assumptions. We can then undergo the author's suggested cognitive therapy process by examining the results and replacing the irrational thoughts with rational ones.

## Reflection: Cross-Analysis, Ikigai, Values

### Cross-Analysis - comparing answers across sections

Now that you've gone through some or all of the question sets, I suggest combining insights with a process I call _cross-analysis_. This is where you ask how one result informs another to expand your understanding and deepen the meaning of the results.

1. Determine the areas that you made notable discoveries and/or want to focus on.
2. Write about what those discoveries meant to you and how they could apply to various situations. Incorporate as many life areas as you like.
3. For even more insights, systematically go through each pair of question sets. A few examples:
    - "My play personality is _Creator_ and I also have a cognitive style of _Innovator_. How does one inform the other? Could I approach what I create analytically? Would I benefit from doing more experimentation? How could I benefit from being more practical and personable (my supposed cognitive weaknesses)?"
    - "Given my low scores on physical health and tendency to be work-centered and risk-averse, how can I motivate myself given my strengths to exercise in a way that works for me?"

Some questions for overall reflection:

- Compare each response to your original answers (as suggested earlier).
- Can you trace each response back to childhood or even a genetic component? How does it further exemplify your personality?
- What do you approach, what do you avoid? (look at this neutrally)
- How do your strengths benefit you? (for self-esteem building and goal-setting)
- Which weaknesses are causing you detriment? (helps you identify areas you might want to account for)
- What can you change in order to improve your life?

### Ikigai - Finding Life Purpose

> Ikigai is a Japanese concept that translates to "a reason for being." It's the idea of finding one's purpose in life and aligning it with one's passions, skills, and values. The Japanese believe finding and pursuing your ikigai is the key to a long and happy life.

&mdash; [7 Japanese Concepts That Can Improve Your Life | The Art of Manliness](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/7-japanese-concepts-that-can-improve-your-life/)

For our purposes, we're using Ikigai as a way to continue cross-analysis. There are four areas that you might be better prepared to reflect on after answering some of the above questions:

- **what you love**
- **what you're good at**
- **what the world needs**
- **what you can be paid for**

The intersection of adjacent areas reveals 4 ways of approaching work and life:

- **Mission** - love + world needs
- **Passion** - love + good at
- **Profession** - good at + paid
- **Vocation** - paid + world needs

&mdash; [Ikigai - sloww.co](https://www.sloww.co/ikigai/)

### Determining and Living By Values

This final section is where we take our newfound self-knowledge and use it to determine and fine tune our values.

- Identify Core Values: Reflect on personal beliefs, standards, and important qualities.
- Define Goals: Set goals that align with your values, ensuring actions are meaningful and fulfilling.
- Use Values as a Decision-Making Compass: Align your actions with your values to provide clarity and reduce self-doubt.
- Increase Self-Awareness: Regularly assess how your daily actions align with your values to understand your priorities and behaviors.
- Reflect and Adjust: Evaluate your daily actions and decisions to ensure they align with your values.
- Be Consistent and Adapt: Regularly review and adjust your values to stay true to yourself.

Suggestions going forward:

- **You can get to know people better** - Encourage others you know to take some of the tests you found the most interesting. Use what you learned about yourself as an opportunity to get to know people better.

Things to remember:
