Iâ€™m a programmer, musician, writer, and educator. I'm fascinated with technology and it's intersection with the creative process.

## Software Engineering

I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, and React. I enjoy building applications with a focus on great user experience - be it web, mobile, command-line, or desktop applications. My favorite technologies include NextJS, Gatsby, Electron, Web Audio APIs (ToneJS), SCSS, Express, Sequelize, and related testing frameworks. I'm also capable in utilizing deployment technologies (Github Actions, Gitlab Pipelines), AWS (Lambda, S3, ECS, etc), Python, and SQL (PostgreSQL).

Please [contact me](/contact) for consulting purposes, speaking engagements (tech talks), mentoring, or teaching workshops.

I studied recording engineering, composition, and jazz guitar at the
Peabody Conservatory and graduated in 2007.
