## About Dave

I'm a professional musician and programmer who loves the intersection of art and technology.

Around the year 2000, I taught myself HTML from a Netscape book. Throughout my music career, I've built dozens of portfolio and band websites using HTML, CSS, and Wordpress. My passion for coding solidified after a decision to study computer science fundamentals with Python as my language of choice (and now, you can't pull me away from my coding projects!)

My programming skills includes making websites and programs using:
- HTML, CSS3, SASS, Twitter Bootstrap, Wordpress
- JavaScript and frameworks including Angular 1.x, Aurelia, JQuery
- Tools including Grunt, Gulp, Browserify, Git, Command-Line
- Chrome Extensions
- REST APIs
- Python, Object-Oriented Programming, Scratch
- Mac OS, iOS, Windows

My goals are to gain expertise in the following:
- Javascript frameworks including React, Vue, and Angular
- Databases including MongoDB and SQL
- Node.js, Express.js
- Python frameworks including Flask and Django
- Cython
- Tools including WebPack
- WebAssembly
- Languages including C, C++, PHP, Go
- Functional Programming
- Advanced fields of computer science

I am currently seeking entry-level programming positions and internships with strong mentorship component. Please contact me [here](../contact) or with the form below if you're have an opportunity you'd like to share with me.
