## About Dave

I'm a musician and programmer who loves learning about technology and making useful things to share on the web.

My technical mind influences how I approach music. As a recording engineer, I've come to deeply understand how analog and digital technologies work. As a professional performing multi-instrumentalist and singer, I've learned how to relax and have fun while under pressure. Finally, as a teacher, I've grown to love to organizing information and sharing it so others may understand.

My interest in programming began around the year 2000 when I began to make simple sites to share my using using HTML. (I taught myself HTML from a Netscape book!) Since then, I've built dozens of portfolio and band websites using HTML, CSS, and Wordpress. My passion for computer science solidified after taking a [course in the fundamentals using Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/). Nowadays, it's very difficult to pull me away from my coding projects!

My programming skills includes making websites and programs using:
- HTML, CSS3, SASS, Twitter Bootstrap, Wordpress
- JavaScript and frameworks including Angular 1.x, Aurelia, JQuery
- Tools including Grunt, Gulp, Browserify, Git, Command-Line
- Chrome Extensions
- REST APIs
- Python, Object-Oriented Programming, Scratch
- Mac OS, iOS, Windows

My goals are to gain expertise in the following:
- Javascript frameworks including React, Vue, and Angular
- Databases including MongoDB and SQL
- Node.js, Express.js
- Server technology, best security practices
- Linux and advanced command line usage
- Python frameworks including Flask and Django
- Cython
- Tools including WebPack
- WebAssembly
- Languages including Java, C, C++, PHP, Go
- Functional Programming
- Advanced fields of computer science

I am currently seeking entry-level programming positions, apprenticeships, and internships. Please contact me [here](../contact) or with the form below if you're have an opportunity you'd like to share with me.
